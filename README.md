Comparative Analysis of ICMP, DNS, and SYN Flooding Attacks on System Resource Utilization


•	SYN floods appear to have the most noticeable effect on CPU usage due to the management of half-open TCP connections, but memory usage does not increase drastically.

•	DNS floods cause a moderate increase in CPU usage since the system is handling a high volume of DNS queries. The memory usage remains largely unaffected.

•	ICMP floods have the least impact on system resources in terms of both CPU and memory.
